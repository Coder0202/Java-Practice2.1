# Java-Practice2.1
This is my Java Practice 2.1
Let's work on some Java practice questions! To give you the most relevant and helpful practice, it would be great to know what specifically you'd like to focus on. Java is a broad topic! To get started, I'll offer a few different types of questions. You can choose which area you'd like to work on, or if you have something else in mind, just let me know. We can cover:

Basic Syntax and Data Types: These questions will test your understanding of variables, operators, loops, conditional statements, etc.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts: These will focus on classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Exception Handling: Questions about try-catch blocks, different exception types, and best practices.
Collections Framework: Working with Lists, Sets, Maps, and other data structures.
Multithreading: Basic concepts of threads, synchronization, and concurrency.
Input/Output (I/O): Reading and writing files, working with streams.
Generics: Understanding and using generic classes and methods. Here's a simple starter question to get us going: Question 1 (Basic Syntax): Write a Java program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop. Once you've tried that, tell me if you'd like more questions on basic syntax, or if you'd prefer to move on to one of the other topics listed above. If you have a specific area you're struggling with, definitely let me know so I can tailor the questions to your needs. The more specific you are, the better I can help!
