//Q32. There is a JAR full of candies for sale at a mall counter. JAR has the capacity N, that is JAR can contain maximum N candies when JAR is full. At any point of time. JAR can have M //number of Candies where M<=N. Candies are served to the customers. JAR never remains empty as when the last k candies are left. JAR is refilled with new candies in such a way that JAR gets //full.
//Write a code to implement the above scenario. Display JAR at the counter with the available number of candies. Input should be the number of candies one customer can order at a point of //time. Update the JAR after each purchase and display JAR at Counter.
//Output should give the number of Candies sold and the updated number of Candies in JAR. If Input is more than candies in JAR, return: “INVALID INPUT”.
//Given,
//N=10, where N is NUMBER OF CANDIES AVAILABLE
//K =< 5, where k is the number of minimum candies that must be inside JAR ever.
//Example 1:  	(N = 10, k =< 5)
//• Input Value - 3
//• Output Value - NUMBER OF CANDIES SOLD : 3
//-        NUMBER OF CANDIES AVAILABLE : 7
//Example :    	(N=10, k<=5)
//• Input Value - 0
//• Output Value - INVALID INPUT
//-        NUMBER OF CANDIES LEFT : 10
